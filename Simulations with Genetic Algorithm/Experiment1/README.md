# Experiment 1 - Red pheromone

## Objective
The objective of this experiment was to observe the behaviour of the ants as they evolve with more parameters.

## Ant's parameters 
- RedPheromoneIntensity

  Default value : 60
  
  Lower Bound : 0
  
  Upper Bound : 255
  
- GreenheromoneIntensity

  Default value : 60
  
  Lower Bound : 0
  
  Upper Bound : 255

- TIMEOUT - ant's lifetime

  Default value : 400
  
  Lower Bound : 0
  
  Upper Bound : 15000

- PHEROMONE_EVAPORATION - rate that pheromone evaporates

  Default value : 400
  
  Lower Bound : 0
  
  Upper Bound : 15000

## Observations

  Due to the configuration of the environment as shown in Figure 1 below, the ants found the surprising configuration of not using the red pheromone (the pheromone responsible for helping them go home).
